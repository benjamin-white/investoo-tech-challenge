* _**If you'd had more time, what would you have changed?**_  
If I had more time I would improve test coverage and reliability - are there false positives or vice versa? Are there scenarios not checked by the test? I would also refine the filtering implementation where I made some assumptions about how the front-end would send queries. I would also like to move the specifics of how each field is queried out of the offers service to allow easier composition and modular testing in the future.  

* _**How would you improve the performance of this API?**_  
Not directly the API but to improve performance I would look into how best to seed test data as I think writing and flushing data between tests could slow down a bigger test suite and probably wasn't the optimal way for me to do it. For the API itself I would want to explore the feasibility of migrating the structure of the database. Moving serialized fields to table columns or using separate tables with foreign keys would make querying faster I think (I did try using SQL but was not able to satisfactorily write queries on the contents of the offers column &mdash; notably there the limitation could be mine).
